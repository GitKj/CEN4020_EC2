The --trace provides users with a log of the value of the variables during each state as the program runs. 
Because the program has a few for-loops, a few of the states are being executed on line 14 and 16, and updating variables on line 14, 18 and 20. 
The assert lines are at the end of the main function, thus it checks the value of the variables (in this case, ‘y’) throughout the program. 
CBMC checks the value of the variables and because the value of y is greater than 0 throughout the duration of the program, then that assert passes. 
However, the next assert is checking for if ‘x’ is equal to 0 at any point during the program. 
This assert fails, because as we can see the very first thing that the tracelog outputs is the fact that during State 24 and line 10, the value of 'x' is actually 0.
X is set to zero because on line 10 of the program, we set the value of x to nondet(), which has no return value, thus automatically returning the value of 0.
